# Render Service Environment Settings
#
# Copy/paste the following key/value into the Render dashboard under:
#   Service → Environment → Environment Variables.
#
# Render automatically injects a `PORT` value at runtime. Setting it
# explicitly here keeps local and hosted configurations aligned.
#
PORT=10000

# (Optional) add any other backend secrets here, e.g.
# ANALYTICS_API_KEY=your-api-key
# COMMAND_INSIGHTS_URL=https://example.com/api
