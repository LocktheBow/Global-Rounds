# Revenue Model Assumptions

- **Ordering Automation**: Converts performance agent `time_saved_minutes` into labor value using a $28/hour blended rate.
- **Payments Recovery**: Blends projected cash recovered with labor minutes saved in the finance agent snapshot.
- **Workforce Optimization**: Applies a 10% efficiency uplift to forecasted team hours across the four-week pipeline horizon.
- **Valuation Multipliers**: Annual recurring value multiplied by 4Ã— to approximate a conservative workflow SaaS multiple.
- All calculations source live data via `python cli.py revenue-model --as-of YYYY-MM-DD` and can be tuned by editing `analysis/revenue_model.py`.
